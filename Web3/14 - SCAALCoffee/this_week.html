          <h2>What makes SCAAL the best coffee?</h2>
          <p>
            Anders has passed down the knowledge he learned as an apprentice in the coffee fields to
            every buyer, roaster, and franchise owner.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            SCAAL's standards for coffee are never compromised. We only select SHB &#34 strictly hard
            bean or strictly high grown &#34 coffee beans.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            To ensure their flavorful oils are preserved, extraordinary steps are taken to protect the coffee bean from
            heat, light, air and moisture. All these efforts are made so that we may offer you a perfect cup of coffee.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            There are so many places you could go to buy coffee. We've gone to extraordinary efforts to ensure that
            SCAAL is your best choice.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The quality begins at harvest. SCAAL relies on selective picking, a labor-intensive process that involves
            making several passes among the trees for those cherries that are perfectly ripe. Then we select top grade
            SHB, which stands for strictly hard bean or strictly high grown. Beans that are grown at a minimum altitude
            of 4,000 feet above sea level for optimum flavor. Within hours of shipping our coffee to you, the beans are
            roasted on-site in small batches by a Certified Roastmaster and vacuum-packed to retain its fresh taste and
            rich aroma.
