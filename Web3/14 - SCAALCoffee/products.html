          <h2>Where we began</h2>
          <p>Anders Carlson lived a sheltered
            life in a small fishing village in
            Marstrand, Sweden. As a child,
            he listened to stories of his
            grandfather Oluf &#39s adventures
            and expeditions. Often his
            grandfather would bring back
            exotic coffees for the family to
            enjoy. Upon his graduation
            Anders left home to see the world.
            He worked all kinds of odd jobs.
            He worked in Parisian cafes and
            Italian espresso bars. He worked
            in the coffee fields of Brazil and
            New Guinea. And in a few years,
            Anders learned the art of selecting
            the perfect coffee bean and roasting
            it to perfection. He returned home
            in 1980 to open the first SCAAL in
            Stockholm, Sweden.
          </p> 
          <br>
          <p>
            By creating his own unique blends of coffee and a stimulating atmosphere, SCAAL quickly became the place to
            gather &#34 day or night &#34 not only in Stockholm, Sweden, but 670 cities around the world.
